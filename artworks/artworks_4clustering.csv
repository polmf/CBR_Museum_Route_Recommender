Art (Arthur) Paul (b. January 18, 1925 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American graphics designer and the designer of the Playboy bunny.

Paul studied at the Art Institute of Chicago (1940-1943) and at the Institute of Design [Illinois Institute of Technology](1946-1950). He was working as a freelance designer when he in 1953 was contacted by playboy founder Hugh Hefner who needed a logo for his new magazine. He created the now famous rabbit wearing a tuxedo bow tie. Paul went on to design the whole first edition of the magazine and was hired by Hefner as Playboy's first art director in 1954, a position he held for 30 years.

In 1986 Paul was elected to the Hall of Fame of the Art Directors Club of New York.
